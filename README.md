# BingPlus
An extension to Microsoft's Bing search engine - solving the problem of 'information overabundance.' 

- What is the problem of 'information overabundance?'
  The internet has given us the ability to search for virtually anything you could think of. With so much information   at your fingertips, the brain becomes overwhelmed with choices. For each concious decision your brain needs to     
  make, for example which link to click out of millions, the brain becomes increasingly strained. Suddenly you find 
  yourself scrolling through Facebook endlessly. 

- How does Bing+ solve this problem? 
  User generated ratings from people who have already tried out the links you're looking at will guide you to the 
  most relevent and helpful sites for you. Overall ratings will tell you the overall site popularity and usefulness, 
  and comments will tell you why.
